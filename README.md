📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project<br>
<br>
🚀 Comprehensive Data Warehousing & Analytics Solution<br>
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data warehouse implementation — from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights. It follows industry best practices in Data Engineering, Data Modeling, and Analytics to deliver a portfolio-ready showcase of skills.<br>
<br>


🏛 Architecture Overview<br>
We implement the Medallion Architecture with three layers:<br>
🥉 Bronze – Stores raw data exactly as received from source systems (CSV → SQL Server).<br>
🥈 Silver – Performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization for analysis readiness.<br>
🥇 Gold – Houses business-ready data in a star schema optimized for reporting and analytics.<br>
